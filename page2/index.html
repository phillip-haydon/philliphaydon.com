      <p>There's so much information on the internet in terms of JavaScript Unit Testing and how to run tests etc, but when it comes to running tests in Visual Studio, without a browser, there's very little information. I had to piece information together to figure it out.</p>

<p>So I'm going to do a small series on this.</p>

<p>Things you will need!</p>

</ol>

<h2>Setup PhantomJS</h2>

<p>To run JavaScript tests without a browser, we need PhantomJS, and we need to wire it up into Resharper.</p>

        <span>posted on 05 Oct 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Last week I saw a tweet about Semantic-UI, which I had not heard about, I guess it's relatively new. I decided to take a look and to be honest. I love what I see.</p>

<p>So to get rolling I decided to create a basic registration form for a personal project using it. </p>

<h2>What is Semantic UI</h2>

<p>Well, for starters, its a rather large library :| coming in total at a whopping 333kb for just the minified CSS an JavaScript.</p>

<p>That's not including the Fonts <em>(roughly 50kb, unless you like SVG which is 194kb, but who the hell uses that crap)</em>, Images which are about 3-10kb, though you probably only use 1 or 2 per app depending on what you're doing. These are all loading gifs, all other images are... well done using Font-Awesome. Which happens to be rolled into the library.</p>

<p>But for what the library does, its pretty damn impressive. </p>

<p>The idea is that Semantic is a more fluent and structured way to writing a web application, rather than naming stuff poorly like Bootstrap does with things like <code>col-lg-4</code>, Semantic opts for <code>column</code>. This is both good and bad. The examples on their homepage are more semantic, but at the cost of either writing less or more code in order to describe the UI elements in the markup. </p>

<p>Reading the examples is awesome, in fact I wanted to right align a button, I started out with:</p>

<p><code>ui blue submit button</code></p>

<p>I thought "I want that floated right, it would look better...", and I ended up with</p>

<p><code>ui blue submit button floated right</code></p>

<p>You end up writing lots but instead of shifting around in CSS to figure out how to move it from left to right, I just described it. Sure enough, button sat on the right hand side!</p>

      <p>I've only been blogging since 2009, and my blog had gone through multiple iterations. I began on BlogEngine.NET, moved onto Wordpress, then was introduced to Jekyll. </p>

<p>I loved Jekyll, but I personally found it fiddly, and people who I've spoken to have also found it fiddly, but are quiet happy after they had set it up.</p>

<p>I really liked the idea, so I thought I would recreate it in .NET :) Because reinventing the wheel is fun!</p>

<h2>Introducing Sandra.Snow</h2>

<p>With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/jchannon">@jchannon</a>, I've managed release Snow. Using NancyFX we have created a small application that allows you to write Markdown Posts with Razor Layouts, which will be compiled static HTML files.</p>

<p>Currently, besides my own, I'm aware of 3 other blogs running on Snow:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com">blog.jonathanchannon.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thecodejunkie.com/">thecodejunkie.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.owenrumney.co.uk/">blog.owenrumney.co.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So what is it? Basically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sandra.Snow is a Jekyll inspired static site generation tool that can be run locally, as a CAAS(Compiler as a Service) or setup with Azure to build your site when your repository changes. It is built on top of NancyFX.</p>

      <p>Just today, <a href="https://twitter.com/chr_horsdal">Christian Horsdal</a> released his first book, his first topic to write a book about, only the most awesome Web Framework to exist in .NET! :)</p>

<p><img src="/images/nancy-book-review-1a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>non affiliate links</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FF8OKP8">Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/nancy-web-development/book">Packt Publishing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This book is rather short, clocking in at only 74 pages. Not to worry though, it covers quite a bit! </p>

<p>Usually I don't go near Packt Publishing books after having a bad experience buying a few books, all of which were terrible. But seeing as this was a Nancy book I couldn't pass up the chance to check it out. </p>

<p>Considering this is the first book Christian has written, it reads very well. I've read books from authors who have done 3 or 4 books and I struggle to read them because their style of writing. So that alone impressed me about this book.</p>

      <p>It was only little over a week ago that ReSharper 8 came out. It's not something that I really follow, but because of that I keep finding all these new features in R# 8 that are absolutely AWESOME!</p>

<p>The R# team, if you see this. Congrats on such an awesome effort really pushing the boundaries of what R# can do with V8.  </p>

<h2>ToString on Dates!</h2>

<p>This is simply amazing, often I would throw up Google and search "stevex string format" and pull up a pretty detailed blog post on string formatting. </p>

<p><img src="/images/resharper8-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This single feature along, in my opinion, is worth the $ to upgrade to R# 8!!!! </p>

<h2>Prelude!</h2>

<p>ServiceStack is great, specially when you need to support .NET 3.5 and don't have the pleasure of being able to use .NET 4.0/4.5, you're not limited to .NET 3.5, ServiceStack works great with .NET 4.0/4.5 as well!</p>

<p>God forbid we get subjected to having to use WCF...</p>

<p>Setting this up should be super easy, we will use all the same settings as NancyFX, the only difference is we will be running ServiceStack instead. </p>

<p>The ServiceStack team take real care to ensure that it works on Mono, enough so that their website; <a href="http://www.servicestack.net">http://www.servicestack.net</a>, runs on Linux!</p>

      <p>Time to setup NancyFX on Mono.</p>

<h2>Prelude!</h2>

<p>This series is done using Mono 2.10 and .NET 4.0. This wont work with a 4.5 project since we need Mono 3.0 for that, but I plan to do another series on building Mono from source since there's no package available yet.</p>

<p>Also, this post assumes you've setup FTP to upload the files, I'm not going to go into detail, but you can install <code>vsftpd</code> and Google the setup. If you're new to Linux and followed Parts 1-3 so far, it should be easy enough to setup and install. All you need to do is authenticate using sshftp or sftp, rather than normal ftp. </p>

<h2>Creating a Nancy test project</h2>

<p>The easiest way to create a test project is to grab the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1e29f61-4dff-4b1e-a14b-6bd0d307611a">Nancy Templates</a> from the Visual Studio Gallery. </p>

<p>Using this method, we can create a new project in Visual Studio and select Nancy Application.</p>

      <p>Now we get to the fun stuff, getting up Mono. I'll be demoing with Mono 2.10 but after this series I may include a 6th part on how build Mono 3.0 from source and run it. </p>

<h2>Setting up our test page</h2>

<p>I figured we should start with setting up our test page. Something super simple, we will create a new page that outputs a bit of server side text. </p>

<p>We wont deploy a bin folder or anything like that, it will be almost like deploying Classic ASP. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" %&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head runat="server"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;% var test = "Hello World! Got an aspx page running on nginx!!!"; %&gt;

    &lt;%= test %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So we are just creating a variable named <code>test</code> with some test data, then outputting it to the page. </p>

      <p>The purpose of series is to be able to create an end-to-end setup of a Linux Server on Azure and deploy a brand new production NancyFX website or ServiceStack service, and not get confused in-between. Like I was when I sussed all this out. :)</p>

<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>When using IIS I think it's safe to say a large majority of us would use the GUI to configure or create new Web Sites. Even though it's actually possible to create a new website and configure it entirely through Powershell.</p>

<p>But, as scary as it sounds it's not too hard to configure a new Website in nginx. I actually think its easier than doing it with Apache, despite the fact that they are relatively similar. </p>

      <p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I'm breaking this up into 5 parts because otherwise it gets far too long :(</span></p>

<p>So after spending a week with OSX, I thought I would see how well I go with setting up Mono on Ubuntu... on Azure. </p>

<p>Turns out it's actually rather simple!</p>

<h2>Setting up the Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>Setting up the virtual machine is pretty straight forward. From the Azure Portal, click the Virtual Machines tab, and select New. </p>

<p>I create mine from the gallery rather than the quick option.</p>

<p>Select <code>Ubuntu Server 13.04</code> from the options, give your new server a name. For Authentication I recommend making a password rather than uploading an SSH key. Only because if you're new or trying this out just to play around, that stuff is probably too difficult for now :)</p>
