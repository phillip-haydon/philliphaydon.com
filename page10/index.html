      </h1> 
      
      <p>Yesterday, my new Windows Phone 7 arrived. I ordered a HTC HD7 from eBay, since it's like $350 cheaper than buying it from an Australian retailer. Not only that it seems carriers aren't supporting WP7 too much yet, as two shopped that I enquired about the phone, both tried to talk me out of getting a WP7.</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-phone-club-1.png" alt="" /> <img src="/images/windows-phone-club-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Photos from <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_hd7-pictures-3338.php">http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_hd7-pictures-3338.php</a>)</p>

<p>It's definitely far superior to my iPhone4, after spending a night playing around with it, pretty much everything is better, in my opinion. (I will NEVER hand over money for an Apple product ever again.)</p>

<p>The one flaw that Windows Phone 7 does have, is it's contact. Microsoft really dropped the ball on the contact, or 'People' as they call them. The idea is great, but it lacks the ability to sync contact with outlook with ease. Contact's are synced to... everything else.</p>

      <p>One thing I love about working on a legacy application is the weird things I get to problem solve.</p>

<p>A lot of the old system has an awful lot of static method calls, which doesn't leave much to be desired for when it comes to unit testing. I was working on a piece of the system today which is written in .NET 2.0, and is tightly coupled to everything in existence.</p>

<p>I didn't want to go introduce interfaces and wrapper classes in order to abstract out all the dependencies, but I wanted to unit test the work without having to touch the database, which is what these static method calls were doing.</p>

<p>The code I dealt with was something along the lines of...</p>

<pre><code>public class ProductService
{
    public static void Save(Product product)
    {
        throw new Exception("This would normally touch a db...");
    }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Browsing the net today for something to do with Fluent NHibernate I came across a blog post.</p>

<p><a href="http://frankmao.com/2011/01/14/nhibernate-subquery/">http://frankmao.com/2011/01/14/nhibernate-subquery/</a></p>

<p>The blog post is to do with Subquery, but I got a little bit confused since the post itself doesn't have anything to do with Subqueries.</p>

<p>About the actual post tho, NHibernate.Linq does actually support Min/Max operators.</p>

<p>Infact I just wrote a quick test to see the SQL it generated, the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var result = session.Linq&lt;TestProduct&gt;().Max(x =&gt; x.Value);
</code></pre>

<p>Generates the following SQL.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT max(this_.Value) as y0_
FROM   [TestProduct] this_
</code></pre>

<p>NHibernate.Linq has basically been deprecated however since NH3.0 has it's own built in Linq provider, rewriting that query in NH3.0 would look like:</p>

<pre><code>var result = session.Query&lt;BaseClass&gt;().Max(x =&gt; x.Id);
</code></pre>

      <p>Finding which process belonged to which application pool was simple in IIS6, it was a simple case of running up a Command Prompt and typing in <code>iisapp.vbs</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the script wasn't bought across to IIS7. So when it came to profiling a site I was baffled as to why the DotTrace results were showing information for threads completely unrelated to the website I was looking at.</p>

<p>Turns out I was looking at the wrong Process Id...</p>

<p><img src="/images/process-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I needed to figure out which Process Id belonged to which site.</p>

        <span>posted on 23 Apr 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Was asked me a couple of weeks ago if it was possible to have nested collections in a jQuery template. Well you can! The sample code kind of buries the ability since it tries to demonstrate too many things at once. But it's rather simple.</p>

<pre><code>{{"{{each *array*"}}}}
    *stuff*
{{"{{/each"}}}}
</code></pre>

<p>So assuming we have a simple json object like...</p>

<pre><code>var people = [
    {
        firstName: "James",
        favouriteColours: [ 
            { colorName: "green" },
            { colorName: "red" }
        ]
    },
    {
        firstName: "Jack",
        favouriteColours: [
            { colorName: "blue" },
            { colorName: "red" }
        ]
    },
    {
        firstName: "Jim",
        favouriteColours: [
            { colorName: "blue" },
            { colorName: "black" },
            { colorName: "white" }
        ]
    }
];
</code></pre>

<p>We can iterate over the people and then their favourite colours by using <code>each</code> in the template like so:</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>The title may be a bit leading, this isn't about querying one-to-many-to-many, that is simply not possible. Well it may be possible, but it's not practical by any means.</p>

<p>It's not practical because when querying for one-to-many you end up with a cartesian product. With a one-to-many it's easy to transform the data knowing the root is a single result while the relationship is a collection of all the results.</p>

<p>If you have a many-to-many it works too since it's the distinct root and the relating collection of all results for a single root item.</p>

<p>But to select a one-to-many-to-many it's far too complicated to work out what the hell is going on.  Well in my opinion it's far too complicated.</p>

<p>The example on the website shows a directory path, but when you look at the help in the command windows it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all output going to: c:mongodblogs 
  logpath [c:mongodblogs] should be a file name not a directory</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, maybe the documentation isn't up to date, but specifying a physical file, like 'log.txt' the service installs fine.</p>

      <p>Every now-n-then I read threads on forums to do with pay &amp; salary in the IT industry, and it always frustrates me when I come across posts where people are whinging about junior / no experience jobs being offered for 'low pay'.</p>

<p>In the thread the original poster was complaining about a job ad being advertised at 35-40k, for a grad position. It seems that a lot of people agree with him. Some of the comments are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>35k is shockingly low. You could walk out and get an office job with no training and no stress for that amount. As a grad you will have to be learning things in your spare time etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->
> I still think it's dangerous practice to offer an absolutely disgraceful salary like $35k to gradutes

<!-- -->
> 35k is a a stupid sallary for a new Grad in this day and age. Heck, as a grad I would even consider 50k too low. Good luck trying to fill that role !!
