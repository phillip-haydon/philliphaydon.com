      <p>The title may be a bit leading, this isn't about querying one-to-many-to-many, that is simply not possible. Well it may be possible, but it's not practical by any means.</p>

<p>It's not practical because when querying for one-to-many you end up with a cartesian product. With a one-to-many it's easy to transform the data knowing the root is a single result while the relationship is a collection of all the results.</p>

<p>If you have a many-to-many it works too since it's the distinct root and the relating collection of all results for a single root item.</p>

<p>But to select a one-to-many-to-many it's far too complicated to work out what the hell is going on.  Well in my opinion it's far too complicated.</p>

      <p>Just tried to install MongoDB as a service on Windows 7, but came up with issues trying to specify where to store the logs...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Windows+Service">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Windows+Service</a></p>

<p>The example on the website shows a directory path, but when you look at the help in the command windows it says:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mongodb-install-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all output going to: c:mongodblogs 
  logpath [c:mongodblogs] should be a file name not a directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure why, maybe the documentation isn't up to date, but specifying a physical file, like 'log.txt' the service installs fine.</p>

      <p>Every now-n-then I read threads on forums to do with pay &amp; salary in the IT industry, and it always frustrates me when I come across posts where people are whinging about junior / no experience jobs being offered for 'low pay'.</p>

<p>In the thread the original poster was complaining about a job ad being advertised at 35-40k, for a grad position. It seems that a lot of people agree with him. Some of the comments are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>35k is shockingly low. You could walk out and get an office job with no training and no stress for that amount. As a grad you will have to be learning things in your spare time etc.</p>
</blockquote>

> 35k is a a stupid sallary for a new Grad in this day and age. Heck, as a grad I would even consider 50k too low. Good luck trying to fill that role !!

        <span>posted on 30 Jan 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>A friend asked me about fetching relationships with NHibernate when something couldn't be lazy-loaded.</p>

<p>The reason it couldn't be lazy-loaded was because he uses Session-Per-Call, my preference is Session-Per-Request. (this is web based, I've never actually used NHibernate in a non-web scenario, yet)</p>

<p>The solution he's currently using is to turn off lazy-loading at the mapping. This is all kinds of bad.</p>

<p>I think it's best to demonstrate why turning off lazy-loading at the mapping is bad. I've come up with a, well what I consider pretty standard Blog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhibernate-lazy-load-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nothing special but needed something that has a few relationship"s. (I think you can click that image to make it bigger)</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>A while ago <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/">MindScape</a> posted a new feature called <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/14/ninja-domain-properties-in-lightspeed/">Ninja Properties</a> for their ORM, LightSpeed. Their post happened to be a scenario I used to solve with LINQ 2 SQL using the 'let' keyword to create a composite type to query against.</p>

<p>This would allow you to do something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>var poo = from s in ctx.Members
          let fullname = s.FirstName + " " + s.LastName
          where fullname == "Robert Williams"
          select s;
</code></pre>

<p>This nifty query would generate SQL like so:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [t1].[Id], [t1].[FirstName], [t1].[LastName]
FROM (
    SELECT [t0].[Id], [t0].[FirstName], 
           [t0].[LastName], 
           ([t0].[FirstName] + ' ') + [t0].[LastName] AS [value]
    FROM [Member] AS [t0]
    ) AS [t1]
WHERE [t1].[value] = 'Robert Williams'
</code></pre>

<p>After commenting in their blog post about it they implemented it and put it into the nightly build. So after some months I finally got around to testing it, for a couple of reasons. Back when NHibernate 3.0 was in Alpha, this technique didn't work! So I thought I would test it out and see if it does, as well as checkout the SQL that's generated.</p>

<p>Why can't NHibernate do this! And when I say why can't NHibernate do this, I mean, why can't NHibernate do this with Query/QueryOver.</p>

<p>Ayende detailed this time last year, the ability to <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/01/27/nhibernate-new-feature-lazy-properties.aspx">lazy-load properties</a>, but currently Query/QueryOver only support One-To-Many and One-To-One relationships.</p>

<p>NHibernate will support the ability to Lazy-Load a property but you can't specify it to be eager loaded.</p>

<p>So you do</p>

<pre><code>Map(x =&gt; x.FullDescription).CustomSqlType("NTEXT") 
                           .LazyLoad();
</code></pre>

<p>Running a query would result in:</p>

      <p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.philliphaydon.com/2010/09/queryover-with-nhibernate-3-lovin-it/">my experience with NHibernate 3.0 and Query over</a> by having a go at converting an application to NH3.0, and faced the challenge of writing a query which contained an 'exists' where clause. At the time my solution resulted in an 'in' clause since I couldn't work out how to do an exists.</p>

<p>Today at work I faced the same challenge, except this time I solved it  WOO Yay for solving things.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>We have a many-to-many relationship between Jobs and Roles. Which looks something along the lines of:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhibernate-queryover-1.png" alt="" /></p>

        <span>posted on 02 Jan 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I introduced SQLite to our Unit Testing at work to aid with testing the stuff written with NHibernate, most of our repositories are rather simple but some of them require some specific criteria that it would be nice to test our queries work.</p>

<p>The problem is some of the queries have a transaction with the <code>IsolationLevel</code> as <code>ReadUncommitted</code>.</p>

<p>Everything works perfectly fine until it comes to testing, the problem is SQLite does not support anything other than <code>Serializable</code> and <code>ReadCommitted</code>.</p>

<p>I spent a while trying to see if there was a way to have an interceptor for NHibernate to capture the <code>BeginRequest</code> and replace the isolation level with something that would work, when that failed I took a look at extending the SQLite dialect but that just became confusing.</p>

<p>In the end I reflected the <code>System.Data.SQLite</code> assembly (before i downloaded the sourcecode) to see what was happening when <code>BeginTransaction</code> was being called.</p>

<p>There's two places it checks, the first is in <code>SQLiteConnection</code> under <code>BeginTransaction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (isolationLevel != IsolationLevel.Serializable &amp;&amp; isolationLevel != IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted)
    throw new ArgumentException("isolationLevel");
</code></pre>
