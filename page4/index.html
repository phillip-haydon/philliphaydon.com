        <span>posted on 09 Apr 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>With the up and coming release of 0.17 of NancyFX, the routing has been completely rewritten, and now it's super easy to implement your own routing. So I'm going to show you how.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The routing works by defining a route:</p>

<p><code>Get["/products/{id}"]</code></p>

<p>The route is then broken up into segments:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>products</code></li>
<li><code>{id}</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Each segment is checked against a Node Condition in the <code>TrieNodeFactory</code> like so</p>

<pre><code>if (segment.StartsWith("(") &amp;&amp; segment.EndsWith(")"))
{
    return new RegExNode(parent, segment, this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a request comes in, the segment is compared to the node for a match and returns true/false + the captured parameter. </p>

<p>These are a bunch of conditions for checking different nodes, currently Nancy supports out of the box the following nodes.</p>

<h2>Existing Nodes</h2>

<p>This is brief description of the existing nodes that currently exist in 0.17. </p>

<h3>CaptureNode</h3>

<p>This node captures <code>{foo}</code>, or basically any value defined in the segment.</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Apr 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I've been using Raygun.io for a couple of months now and seen a whole heap of new features added.</p>

<h3>Email Spam</h3>

<p>If you had multiple apps you would get spammed with 1 summary email each day for each app, now you get an aggregation of all apps which is much nicer. </p>

<p>If you receive an email for an exception, and that exception keeps occurring, it will email you a little while later saying that you're still receiving the exception, the rate at which its occurring, and if it's happening more or less.</p>

<p>These changes are great! Still the same valuable information, but more smartly distributed to the user.</p>

<h3>Commenting</h3>

<p>I had an error, that occurred a lot... </p>

<p><img src="/images/raygun-features-javascript-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So after fixing it, which took a little bit of effort to figure out, I commented on it!</p>

        <span>posted on 02 Apr 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I had an awesome conversation on Monday with Glenn Block about Microsoft in regards to OSS, as a result Glenn asked me to write a post about what I would like to see Microsoft do.</p>

<p>To be clear, everyone has their own opinions about what Microsoft is doing with Open Source Software, whats working, whats not, that isn't the point of this post. This is about what I would like to see, and why.</p>

<h3>Promote itself with the community, not against it</h3>

<p>One of the things I think Microsoft does is promote itself against the community, it has opened sourced MVC and WebAPI, but people outside the community don't know about the alternatives. </p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that Microsoft actively promotes frameworks like FubuMVC, NancyFX, ServiceStack etc as their own, or in such a way that it overshadows their own stuff. What I would like to see is Microsoft promoting itself along side other frameworks. A lot of the guys who create these other frameworks are advisories for MVC/WebAPI, they help make Microsoft frameworks better, and there's all the people who contribute, and in my personal opinion Microsoft doesn't really give anything back to the community through its main channels.</p>

      <p>I just got done reading a <a href="http://blog.filipekberg.se/2013/03/04/everyone-should-learn-programming/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/fekberg">@fekberg</a> titled "Everyone Should Learn Programming"</p>

<p>This idea that everyone should learn to program seems to be a growing trend. But I disagree. </p>

<p>I don't think <code>everyone</code> should learn to program, I think everyone should get the opportunity to learn to program. Schooling in general is a waste of time because it caters to this idea that life evolves around English, Math, Art, Science and General Knowledge. But real life doesn't, and these things don't help children figure out what they are good at or enjoy.</p>

<p>There's an awesome TED video by Sir Ken Robinson titled "Do Schools Kill Creativity"</p>

        <span>posted on 26 Feb 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>In my last post about <a href="http://www.philliphaydon.com/2013/01/windows-store-app-with-caliburn-micro-basic-binding">Basic Binding</a> we added the ability to Hide/Show a control using Viability property of the control to make it <code>Visible</code> or <code>Collapsed</code></p>

<p>However the View Model shouldn't have any real knowledge of how the view works, meaning it shouldn't actually dictate the visibility using the controls properties.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I left this out of the original post because I wanted to keep it 'Basic' without confusing binding with converters and such, making the topic more complicated</span></p>

<p>If in the future you changed from say <code>TextBlock</code> to a 3rd party control called <code>BananaTextBlock</code> and that 3rd party decided that they were not going to use the built in Viability enum, and instead decided to create their own naming convention, and enum etc. You would be forced to change your ViewModel, which isn't good.</p>

<p>That's where Value Converters come in handy. </p>

<p>The changes in this release break my previous blog post so I'm updating here.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The original post still applies, the change is only to the setup of the App</span></p>

<h2>App Setup</h2>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>I searched for hours trying to figure this out and I think the information is a little scarce or not obvious.</p>

<p>Basically I wanted to add some advertising to my app, I'm trying to cover multiple different area's in order to learn what's involved, and I thought I had it all down, only to work out that the advert's that were displaying were test adverts and not the real thing.</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong, when you actually do find the correct URL (by searching Advertising rather than Ad) the MSDN link does have all the information, I didn't find this out until my friend actually sent it to me...</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/advertising-windows-sdk(v=msads.10).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/advertising-windows-sdk(v=msads.10).aspx</a></p>

<p>There's two main things you need to do (besides installing the correct SDK, I had the Beta first time around)</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the advert into your app</li>
<li>Setup an advertising account</li>
</ol>

<p>The first part is easy... (well the 2nd part is too... but I didn't realise that at first)</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Forms in HTML only allow you to use the method's POST and GET, I'm not sure if this would be classified as a limitation or not, but it does introduce a slight problem when you want to create a nice API taking advantage of verbs such as PUT and DELETE, when you can only POST and GET. </p>

<p>This means if you want to delete something you have to use a different URL, like:</p>

<p><code>/products/123/delete</code></p>

<p>Then define a route like</p>

<pre><code>Post["/products/{id}/delete"] = _ =&gt;
{
    ... Do Something...
};
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't exactly ideal, what we would prefer to have is a more semantic route.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GET</code> -> gets an object</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> -> deletes an object</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> -> modifies an object</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code> -> modifies part of an object</li>
<li><code>POST</code> -> creates an object</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I'm no expert on this stuff so the VERBs above may not be correct wording.</span></p>

<p>This would allow us to define the same route like so</p>

<pre><code>Delete["/products/{id}"] = _ =&gt;
{
    ... Do Something...
};
</code></pre>

        <span>posted on 05 Feb 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>This post is a follow on from my previous post <a href="/2013/01/oauth-with-nancyfx-and-world-domination-authentication/">OAuth with NancyFX and WorldDomination.Web.Authentication</a> except this demonstrates how you can use WorldDomination.Web.Authentication with ASP.NET MVC, writing only minimal code in the process.</p>

<p>To save you jumping to the other post, I'll quote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the biggest pains of building websites, in my opinion, is implementing OAuth providers, it's often fiddly, doesn't work, and frameworks that are created to try make things easier, don't seem to make it easier. </p>
  
  <p>So <a href="https://github.com/PureKrome">PureKrome</a> and myself decided to create <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/WorldDomination.Web.Authentication/">WorldDomination: Web Authentication</a></p>
  
  <p>The idea behind this framework is to keep it super simple to implement OAuth into your website, without the bloat. The core framework ONLY deals with Google, Twitter, and Facebook authentication. It doesn't try to create a fancy UI for you, it doesn't require you to write lots and lots of code. You simply give it some info, it redirects, it comes back and gives you the authentication info.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without further adieu...</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p>Installing the library for MVC requires installing the MVC specific library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PM> Install-Package WorldDomination.Web.Authentication.Mvc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will install:</p>

<ul>
<li>WorldDomination.Web.Authentication.Mvc</li>
<li>WorldDomination.Web.Authentication</li>
<li>RestSharp</li>
</ul>
