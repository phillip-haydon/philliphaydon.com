        <span>posted on 02 Jan 2011</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I introduced SQLite to our Unit Testing at work to aid with testing the stuff written with NHibernate, most of our repositories are rather simple but some of them require some specific criteria that it would be nice to test our queries work.</p>

<p>The problem is some of the queries have a transaction with the <code>IsolationLevel</code> as <code>ReadUncommitted</code>.</p>

<p>Everything works perfectly fine until it comes to testing, the problem is SQLite does not support anything other than <code>Serializable</code> and <code>ReadCommitted</code>.</p>

<p>I spent a while trying to see if there was a way to have an interceptor for NHibernate to capture the <code>BeginRequest</code> and replace the isolation level with something that would work, when that failed I took a look at extending the SQLite dialect but that just became confusing.</p>

<p>In the end I reflected the <code>System.Data.SQLite</code> assembly (before i downloaded the sourcecode) to see what was happening when <code>BeginTransaction</code> was being called.</p>

<p>There's two places it checks, the first is in <code>SQLiteConnection</code> under <code>BeginTransaction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (isolationLevel != IsolationLevel.Serializable &amp;&amp; isolationLevel != IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted)
    throw new ArgumentException("isolationLevel");
</code></pre>

        <span>posted on 28 Dec 2010</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Over the past few days I've moved my blog from BlogEngine.Net to WordPress, since BlogEngine is fail.</p>

<p>I didn't go with a hosted solution since it costs money just to use my own domain name, infact it costs more to use my own domain name than it cost me to register the damn thing. So I investigated blogs and came across:</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.visitmix.com/development/installing-wordpress-on-sql-server">http://wordpress.visitmix.com/development/installing-wordpress-on-sql-server</a></p>

<p>Seems someone or somepeople have ported wordpress to work on SQL Server, so people who are on Windows with SQL Server and don't want to use FailSQL MySQL can take advantage of wordpress.</p>

<p>As much as I hate PHP after moving to .Net, the one thing the PHP community did right was all the different CMS and Blog solutions out there, something the .Net community lacks. As far as I'm concerned there is not one good .Net blogging solution available.</p>

<p>Anyway so far I'm happy with the move. </p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>ASP.Net 4.0 got a brand spanking new feature. Clean ClientID's! ABOUT BLOODY TIME... Only, I'm working on a legacy application which can't be migrated to 4.0 :(</p>

<p>So why do we need Nice Readable, predictable ClientID's? I can think of two main reasons, outside of that, I would assume you're doing it wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li>JavaScript, to find elements...</li>
<li>JavaScript in external files where you can't write spaghetti code.</li>
</ol>

<p>What do I mean by spaghetti code? I mean this stuff:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= txtUserName.ClientID %&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  var element = $('#&lt;%= txtUserName.ClientID %&gt;');
  var textbox = document.getElementById('&lt;%= txtUserName.ClientID %&gt;');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I absolutely detest seeing this sort of thing. It makes me sick, and worst of all you can't pull this sort of code back to an external js file. In Web Forms, spaghetti coding is NOT your presentation, your server control is your presentation, the spaghetti code is your binding, and this should be in the codebehind.</p>

      <p>Had an interesting scenario to solve today, while I was away a bunch of unit tests got turned off since they broke during some refactoring, I spent the day fixing theses unit tests.</p>

<p>The method under test had a dependency on another class, it performed two actions on this class.</p>

<ol>
<li>to get a list of data</li>
<li>to return a DateRange (this is done in a foreach loop)</li>
</ol>

<p>DateRange is just a class with a start/end property of DateTime. The method is sort of like this (obviously with proper names I just wrote some random code to illustrate the scenario)</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;Stuff&gt; GetStuff(DateTime dateList)
{
    var result = new List&lt;Stuff&gt;();
    var someService = IoC.Resolve&lt;ISomeService&gt;();
    var data = someService.GetData();

    foreach (var date in dateList)
    {
        var tempDate = date;
        DateRange range = someService.GetDates(OpenRules, tempDate);
        //do stuff...
    }

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the same service is called twice, the issue is when iterating over the dateList, it needs to be filtered based on a DateRange during the day. So say, 8am till 10pm. Removing the stuff outside of that time period during that day.</p>

<p>Last night I attended the <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/">Sydney Alt.Net</a> user group since <a href="http://www.udidahan.com/">Udi Dahan</a> was attending. There was no specific topic, it was an open questions/answers session with Udi. If you're interested you can watch it <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/2010/11/november-meeting-recorded-for-your.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that interested me most was to do with <a href="http://www.nservicebus.com/">NServiceBus</a> commercial support (<em>1 hour 23 minutes in the video if you want to skip ahead</em>). Initially I thought that it was going from Open Source to requiring a license, a license I wouldn't be able to afford for my hobby projects, however someone asked about the licensing.</p>

<p>Udi must be one of the best presenters I've come across, I always thought he talked a little slow when watching videos of him presenting, but it's an entirely different experience when you're sitting in a room listening to him.</p>

<p>He really makes sure you follow and understand, at no point did I feel like I was left behind. Something that intrigued me however, was there was not one question he could not answer... He must have heard every possible question because people started trying to catch him out with some weird example or scenario, and he was able to answer it.</p>

      <p>Microsoft recently pushed out a Windows Update for their Windows Live Essentials, in this update came Windows Live Messenger.</p>

<p>Wow... what was the Windows Live team thinking when they wrote this? It's the biggest pile of crap ever.</p>

<p>The progression of MSN was fine, sure it was becoming slight bloatware, has some annoying advertising, and some silly features. But it worked well and looked nice.</p>

<p>My biggest pet hate?</p>

<p>If I sent a link to an image, I'm sending a god damn LINK. If I wanted to send an image, I would send an image. But I'm not, I'm sending a LINK.</p>

</ul>

<p>As it turns out, it's really easy to setup. I figured out two ways of doing it, the HiLo table having a single row, with each column for each table 'Hi'. Or a row for each table.</p>

<p>I setup a really simple example with the following table.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhibernate-hilo-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>'ProductId' is set to be int/primary key, but identity is false, since we don't want the database generating the id.</p>

      <p>No longer is Microsoft the evil empire, for Google is the new emerging evil empire. Seriously, Google is the new M$ of the 90's.</p>

<p>It's always bugged me that I use Opera browser for my primary browser, a browser which follows W3 Standards more strictly than any other browser out there.</p>

<p>Yet so many sites fail to support Opera... I had to use IE for years just to do internet banking with ANZ bank, until Opera 9.5 came out, simply because they blocked it. Many other sites seem to suggest using a 'supported' browser, even tho the site works 100% in Opera anyway...</p>

<p>In comes Google, they always hold back on Opera. Google Wave? Gmail? Analytics, all had their issues over the years, and now we have this new super duper feature Google Instant, and their new fancy Image Search.</p>

<p>Except, neither work in Opera...</p>

<p><img src="/images/google-fail-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Except... It actually does work,infact both Google Instant and their fancy Image Search work in Opera.</p>
