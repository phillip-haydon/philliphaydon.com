      <p>For a while I've been wanting to pick-up Ruby, but not rails, every man and his dog is doing rails and everything I read I feel like it tries to do too much, much in the same way I feel ASP.NET MVC get's in the way too much by trying to do too much for me. I think I've written 'too much' too much. :)</p>

<p>So I'm learning Ruby + Sinatra.</p>

<p>Currently I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/">Programming Ruby 1.9</a> but I just went on holiday, and figured a smaller book was a better idea to take with me.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230">Sinatra Up and Running</a></p>

<p>This book, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/anachronistic">Alan Harris</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase">Konstantin Haase</a>, is brilliant. Clocking in at 103 pages (less than the 122 Amazon states), this book is everything you need to get your feet off the ground with Sinatra and get building applications.</p>

      <p>Mindscape, creator of the awesome <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench">Web Workbench</a> tool for visual studio as well as other awesome products, made an <a href="https://twitter.com/MindscapeHQ/status/260851721230761985">announcement</a> today on twitter of a new up coming product they are working on.</p>

<p><a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">Raygun</a></p>

<p>Little is currently known about this since trying to find out more from Mindscape is like squeezing blood from a stone, but what I do know is it's a online error tracking and reporting service, that will allow you to track errors that occur on both the serverside <em>and</em> the clientside.</p>

<p>This looks awesome and quite possible be a great <a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">Elmah Replacement</a> for my projects, since it will have the ability to track clientside issues that usually go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Not only that but the community will be able to contribute their own plugins and extensions to the service!</p>

<p>Apparently Alpha invites will start going out in the next 2 weeks, so head on over to <a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy</a> and signup!</p>

      <p>Every now-n-then someone comes into JabbR or messages me asking about the best way to load a relationship. Often enough what the person is trying to do is Eager load some reference/relational data.</p>

<p>For example, Order / Customer.</p>

<p>If we want to load an Order and get the Customer information at the same time, we can eagerly fetch this information using an ORM, in RavenDB we can Include the results so that when we query them, the session already has the information and doesn't need to round-trip to the database.</p>

<h3>You don't need to!</h3>

<p>There really is nothing wrong with executing two separate queries in this scenario.</p>

<pre><code>var order = Session.Load&lt;Order&gt;(123); 
var customer = Session.Load&lt;Customer&gt;(order.CustomerId);
</code></pre>

<p>These queries are fast to execute, and there really is nothing wrong with it! You can add some complexity in your NHibernate mappings by creating a reference so you can Eagerly fetch the reference and have 1 trip to the database etc. But this really isn't where eager fetching is beneficial!</p>

<p>Last week I had a discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/@PrabirShrestha">@PrabirShrestha</a> in <a href="https://jabbr.net/">JabbR</a> about APIs for MongoDB to achieve something along the lines of:</p>

      <p>A while back <a href="https://twitter.com/ayende">@ayende</a> wrote a <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/156609/reviewing-dinner-party-ndash-nerd-dinner-ported-to-ravendb-on-ravenhq">blog post</a> about <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/DinnerParty">DinnerParty</a> in which he mentioned <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">NancyFX</a>, a lightweight web framework. <a href="https://twitter.com/jchannon">@jchannon</a> recently wrote about a <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/">blog post about NancyFX RavenDB and himself</a>.</p>

<p>So I've spent the better part of the last few months learning it, and needless to say, it's awesome. So I got asked a question, how would I handle 'Areas' with Nancy, like we would with ASP.NET MVC?</p>

<p>Well it's pretty simple, all it really consists of is... a module containing a root path.</p>

<p>Lets begin with the following folder structure defining a 'HomeModule' for both the Root Website, and the Admin section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nancy-areas-1.png" /></p>

<p>Both these HomeModule classes are identical, with the small exception that the Admin one specifies a Root Path.</p>

      <p>I have absolutely no idea who made this retarded feature but if I met them, I would like to think I would punch them in the face for all the pain they have caused me, of making me reformat my computer thinking I had somehow stuffed up my installation of the OS.</p>

<p>Windows 7 and 8 have this feature which allows an application to take priority of the speakers. Meaning if you're in Application A, and you're playing music, and you swap to Application B, then B will reduce the volume of A so that itself can have louder volume.</p>

<p>This is really annoying when you want to play music, and then you load up a game, and the music is drowned out by game sounds.</p>

<p>The solution? Disable that shit!</p>

<p>1) Go into your Playback devices:</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-volume-1.png" /></p>

<p>2) Select the device properties:</p>

<p>In part 3 I want to show you how to query References.</p>

<p>In the previous post I showed you three basic classes that demonstrate a Relationship between Order and OrderLine, and a Reference to User from Order using the UserId.</p>

<p>I've setup some really basic test data:</p>

<pre><code>using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Phillip",
        Surname = "Haydon",
        Username = "phillip.haydon",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Edward",
        Surname = "Norton",
        Username = "edward.norton",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new Order
    {
        UserId = "users/1",
        DateOrdered = DateTime.Now,
        DateUpdated = DateTime.Now,
        Status = "Ordered",
        Lines = new List&lt;OrderLine&gt;
        {
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            },
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            }
        }
    });
    session.SaveChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This creates two collections:</p>

<a href="/2012/07/ravendb-what-am-i-persisting-what-am-i-querying-part-2/">Part 2</a> I want to discuss Relationships &amp; References, and the difference between the two.<br />
<a href="/2012/07/ravendb-what-am-i-persisting-what-am-i-querying-part-3/">Part 3</a>  </p>

<p>Taking from part 1's example, lets add a User to the mix:</p>

<pre><code>public class Order
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string DateOrdered { get; set; }
    public string DateUpdated { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
    public IEnumerable&lt;OrderLine&gt; Lines { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine
{
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public decimal Discount { get; set; }
    public string SkuCode { get; set; }
    // Other Properties
}

public class User
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string Surname { get; set; }
    // Other Properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I've added 'UserId' to the Order, not a 'User' just the Id part. This is because I don't want direct access to the User. <em>(It is possible to map a User in RavenDB, but I don't believe that is always a good idea. Save it for special occasions.)</em></p>

<p>A couple of questions that pop's up a lot in the <a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/RavenDB">#RavenDB</a> <a href="https://jabbr.net/">JabbR</a> chat room by people picking up RavenDB for the first time are; <em>what am I persisting?, and how do I query relationships?.</em></p>

<p>When we use relational databases we often de-normalize our data into multiple tables, usually this is done to get rid of duplication of data. We do this by adding 100's of foreign keys to our tables relating things all over the place, we had a CountryId to our Address, a UserId to our Order, an OrderId to our OrderLine.</p>

<p>There's many reasons why this was done, some of which Oren describes in his <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/153026/embracing-ravendb">Embracing RavenDB post.</a></p>

<p>Then when we go to query those relationships we have to join data, when we have an entity with multiple relationships we end up getting into complex queries with cartesian joins, performance starts to degrade, and things just get messy.</p>

<p>When working with Document Databases we throw all that out the window and we deal with Root Aggregates. These are objects that are responsible for their child objects, you don't load the child objects individually, they are loaded with the root or parent object.</p>

      <p>Yesterday (14th of June) I had a need to run more than one website while running <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrain's</a> <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/">DotTrace</a>, to give a bit of background, Website A needs to redirect to Website B in order to simulate a single sign on.</p>

<p>Website B can't be accessed without using the SSO, so in order to profile Website B I need to run Website A.</p>

<p>The problem is when using DotTrace, I have to select the website I wish to profile:</p>

<p><img src="/images/multiple-iis-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem with that, is that when you run the profiler it only starts up one of the websites. I need it to start both.</p>

<p>This would be easy to profile if the Standard Version came with Attach To Process feature. But unfortunately that only comes with Professional.</p>

<p>That way, when I debug using Visual Studio I could pick the process to profile:</p>
