      <p>I've been investigating setting up a Worker Role to do something similar to a Windows Service and it seems that the Worker Role is best suited for this purpose. </p>

<p>You might create a Worker Role to Poll a Message Queue, or process some data in a database, or scrape some data and persist it, etc. I'm going to throw some data in <a href="http://www.ravenhq.com">http://www.ravenhq.com</a> every minute, for this blog post, nothing exciting, but demonstrates how to create a WorkerRole and get it up and running on Azure.</p>

<p>I suspect that you could use NancyFX Self-Hosting here and host a basic Nancy website, that would be cool :)</p>

<h2>Building the Service (Worker / Role)</h2>

<p>If you haven't already you will need to install the Azure SDK, so head on over to <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/">http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/</a> and click "Install SDK" which will give you the option for 2012 or 2010. I picked 2012 because I don't know what 2010 is, I stopped living in the past.</p>

<p>The installer actually uses Web Platform Installer, not sure if there's any other way to install it.</p>

        <span>posted on 03 Jan 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Apparently WinRT XAML lacks the ability to tile a background image, and surfing the net seems to come to the conclusion that the only way is to just create a large tiled image in photoshop...</p>

<p>I want to pick a Tile image from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">http://subtlepatterns.com/</a> and just use it, but I <em>can't</em>. So I tried photoshop... (creating a benehoth of an image that is) I tried that, and it... crashed the Simulator, over and over... So I flagged it, instead I decided to put in a feature request over at Mindscape for their Metro Elements:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/thinktank/suggestion/505262">http://www.mindscapehq.com/thinktank/suggestion/505262</a></p>

<p>I asked them to include a TiledBackground, and they delivered! </p>

<p>Currently in the nightly build is the makings of a TiledBackground element.</p>

<p>(To get access to the Nightly builds you will need to purchase a license for Metro Elements, which is well worth it, so go buy a license!)</p>

<p>After installing the Metro Elements, in your app you want to add a reference to Metro Elements:</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-app-tiled-bg-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now in the page attributes you need to include an alias for the MetroElements:</p>

      <p>Shortly after the Microsoft Surface was released I got my hands on one, which wasn't exactly easy since they aren't available in Singapore yet. I had to pay $240 extra to get mine shipped from Hong Kong via <a href="http://www.expansys.com.sg">http://www.expansys.com.sg</a> and then an extra $70 for import tax... </p>

<p>But it was 110% worth it. I use the thing ALL the damn time, and dispite it being limited in functionality due to Windows RT, I don't regret the purchase at all. </p>

<p>There's HEAPS of good reviews on the internet about it so I'm not going to bore you with how amazingly awesome the thing is. </p>

<p>What I want to discuss is 3 issues I have.</p>

<h2>Surface Charger</h2>

<p><img src="/images/surface-issues-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Surface Charger has a Magnetic Power Plug, similar to the old L-shaped MagSafe </p>

      <p>So Phil Jones posted on twitter recently his desire to have multiple Forms Auth's for different area's in a website.</p>

<p>The most common scenario is having an Administration and Member with completely separated logins.</p>

<p><img src="/images/image35.png" /></p>

<p>This is actually really easy in NancyFX. Expanding on my previous post:</p>

<p><a href="/2012/12/forms-authentication-with-nancyfx/">http://www.philliphaydon.com/2012/12/forms-authentication-with-nancyfx/</a></p>

<p>I'm going to include a new area and a couple of new modules:</p>

<p><img src="/images/image36.png" /></p>

<p>I've added a folder called 'Admin' this is to act as an Area as described in my post about Nancy &amp; Areas.</p>

      <p>There's already quite a bit of documentation on the Nancy wiki about forms authentication, but I wanted to write about it anyway.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This is written with Nancy 0.14.1 - this may be subject to change in future versions.</span></p>

<p>Nancy supports a module for forms authentication, it works some-what similar to the way forms auth works in ASP.NET, except it's abstracted away and is not part of the core Nancy engine, which is great. It means that if you don't like the way forms authentication works, you can rip it out and write your own from scratch, or download the project and modify it to your hearts content.</p>

<p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Authentication.Forms">http://nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Authentication.Forms</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/tree/master/src/Nancy.Authentication.Forms">https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/tree/master/src/Nancy.Authentication.Forms</a></p>

<p>If you take a look at the GitHub project, you can see that the implementation is actually really small. So should you want to poke around, there's not much to look at.</p>

        <span>posted on 14 Dec 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>So I've been learning Windows 8 development recently, specifically with C#/XAML, and Caliburn.Micro for the MVVM goodness. This is all brand new stuff for me, never done any WPF, Silverlight or Windows Phone dev. So I figured it's a good chance to blog what I'm learning.</p>

<p>In this post I want to show you how to get up and running.</p>

<p>I started by reading the blog posts over at Mindscape.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/12/caliburn-micro-part-1-getting-started/">http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/12/caliburn-micro-part-1-getting-started/</a></p>

<p>(great series by <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantumNgtmare">@Jason</a>, list of links at bottom of this post)</p>

<p>The downside is they were very WPF centric, and a few things getting started have changed. There's no bootstrapper for example.</p>

        <span>posted on 30 Nov 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Today on twitter, <a href="http://blog.orangelightning.co.uk/">Phil Jones</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/philjones88">@philjones88</a>) asked how you would do RenderAction (ASP.NET MVC extension)</p>

<p>I personally don't like RenderAction in MVC, that's not to say it's bad, I just think it hides away important implementation of a page render. I think RenderAction is a bad abstraction. But this is my personal opinion. So don't hate me for it :)</p>

<p>Rather than using RenderAction I prefer to use Partial views.</p>

<p>Lets look at a youtube site for an example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/partial-renders-nancy-1.png" /></p>

<p>On the left hand side is main content, while on the right hand side is related videos. In ASP.NET MVC we might use something like:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.RenderAction("Related", "Videos");
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar, I forget the syntax :)</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Nov 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>This has to be one of the most awesome features of Nancy, Content Negotiation. Recently added in 0.12, it gives you the ability to implement a single route that responds with different versions of the same document, without having to mess up your code with duplicate methods or conditional statements.</p>

<p>When doing this in ASP.NET MVC I would have to check the content type and decide how I want to respond to the request.</p>

<p>This ended up making duplicate methods, one which would be used by a normal GET request, while the 2nd would be for an AJAX request. Or if it was similar, use conditional logic in the single method to decide how the action should respond...</p>

<p>Nancy on the other hand supports Content Negotiation out of the box.</p>

<pre><code>Get["/negotiated"] = parameters =&gt; {
    return Negotiate
        .WithModel(new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy "})
        .WithMediaRangeModel("text/html", new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy fancy pants"})
        .WithView("negotiatedview")
        .WithHeader("X-Custom", "SomeValue");
};
</code></pre>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Sample taken from Nancy GitHub Repo</span></p>

<h2>What is content negotiation?</h2>

<p>In short, it's the ability to serve different versions of a document to the same URI.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>For a while I've been wanting to pick-up Ruby, but not rails, every man and his dog is doing rails and everything I read I feel like it tries to do too much, much in the same way I feel ASP.NET MVC get's in the way too much by trying to do too much for me. I think I've written 'too much' too much. :)</p>

<p>So I'm learning Ruby + Sinatra.</p>

<p>Currently I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/">Programming Ruby 1.9</a> but I just went on holiday, and figured a smaller book was a better idea to take with me.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230">Sinatra Up and Running</a></p>

<p>This book, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/anachronistic">Alan Harris</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase">Konstantin Haase</a>, is brilliant. Clocking in at 103 pages (less than the 122 Amazon states), this book is everything you need to get your feet off the ground with Sinatra and get building applications.</p>
