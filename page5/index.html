        <span>posted on 14 Dec 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>So I've been learning Windows 8 development recently, specifically with C#/XAML, and Caliburn.Micro for the MVVM goodness. This is all brand new stuff for me, never done any WPF, Silverlight or Windows Phone dev. So I figured it's a good chance to blog what I'm learning.</p>

<p>In this post I want to show you how to get up and running.</p>

<p>I started by reading the blog posts over at Mindscape.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/12/caliburn-micro-part-1-getting-started/">http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/12/caliburn-micro-part-1-getting-started/</a></p>

<p>(great series by <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantumNgtmare">@Jason</a>, list of links at bottom of this post)</p>

<p>The downside is they were very WPF centric, and a few things getting started have changed. There's no bootstrapper for example.</p>

<p>So, here's my blog series.</p>

      <p>Today on twitter, <a href="http://blog.orangelightning.co.uk/">Phil Jones</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/philjones88">@philjones88</a>) asked how you would do RenderAction (ASP.NET MVC extension)</p>

<p>I personally don't like RenderAction in MVC, that's not to say it's bad, I just think it hides away important implementation of a page render. I think RenderAction is a bad abstraction. But this is my personal opinion. So don't hate me for it :)</p>

<p>Rather than using RenderAction I prefer to use Partial views.</p>

<p>Lets look at a youtube site for an example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/partial-renders-nancy-1.png" /></p>

<p>On the left hand side is main content, while on the right hand side is related videos. In ASP.NET MVC we might use something like:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.RenderAction("Related", "Videos");
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar, I forget the syntax :)</p>

        <span>posted on 08 Nov 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>This has to be one of the most awesome features of Nancy, Content Negotiation. Recently added in 0.12, it gives you the ability to implement a single route that responds with different versions of the same document, without having to mess up your code with duplicate methods or conditional statements.</p>

<p>When doing this in ASP.NET MVC I would have to check the content type and decide how I want to respond to the request.</p>

<p>This ended up making duplicate methods, one which would be used by a normal GET request, while the 2nd would be for an AJAX request. Or if it was similar, use conditional logic in the single method to decide how the action should respond...</p>

<p>Nancy on the other hand supports Content Negotiation out of the box.</p>

<pre><code>Get["/negotiated"] = parameters =&gt; {
    return Negotiate
        .WithModel(new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy "})
        .WithMediaRangeModel("text/html", new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy fancy pants"})
        .WithView("negotiatedview")
        .WithHeader("X-Custom", "SomeValue");
};
</code></pre>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Sample taken from Nancy GitHub Repo</span></p>

<h2>What is content negotiation?</h2>

<p>In short, it's the ability to serve different versions of a document to the same URI.</p>

      <p>For a while I've been wanting to pick-up Ruby, but not rails, every man and his dog is doing rails and everything I read I feel like it tries to do too much, much in the same way I feel ASP.NET MVC get's in the way too much by trying to do too much for me. I think I've written 'too much' too much. :)</p>

<p>So I'm learning Ruby + Sinatra.</p>

<p>Currently I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085/">Programming Ruby 1.9</a> but I just went on holiday, and figured a smaller book was a better idea to take with me.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230">Sinatra Up and Running</a></p>

<p>This book, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/anachronistic">Alan Harris</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase">Konstantin Haase</a>, is brilliant. Clocking in at 103 pages (less than the 122 Amazon states), this book is everything you need to get your feet off the ground with Sinatra and get building applications.</p>

      <p>Mindscape, creator of the awesome <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench">Web Workbench</a> tool for visual studio as well as other awesome products, made an <a href="https://twitter.com/MindscapeHQ/status/260851721230761985">announcement</a> today on twitter of a new up coming product they are working on.</p>

<p><a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">Raygun</a></p>

<p>Little is currently known about this since trying to find out more from Mindscape is like squeezing blood from a stone, but what I do know is it's a online error tracking and reporting service, that will allow you to track errors that occur on both the serverside <em>and</em> the clientside.</p>

<p>This looks awesome and quite possible be a great <a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">Elmah Replacement</a> for my projects, since it will have the ability to track clientside issues that usually go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Not only that but the community will be able to contribute their own plugins and extensions to the service!</p>

<p>Apparently Alpha invites will start going out in the next 2 weeks, so head on over to <a href="http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy">http://raygun.io/?ref=1QWEy</a> and signup!</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Every now-n-then someone comes into JabbR or messages me asking about the best way to load a relationship. Often enough what the person is trying to do is Eager load some reference/relational data.</p>

<p>For example, Order / Customer.</p>

<p>If we want to load an Order and get the Customer information at the same time, we can eagerly fetch this information using an ORM, in RavenDB we can Include the results so that when we query them, the session already has the information and doesn't need to round-trip to the database.</p>

<h3>You don't need to!</h3>

<p>There really is nothing wrong with executing two separate queries in this scenario.</p>

<pre><code>var order = Session.Load&lt;Order&gt;(123); 
var customer = Session.Load&lt;Customer&gt;(order.CustomerId);
</code></pre>

<p>These queries are fast to execute, and there really is nothing wrong with it! You can add some complexity in your NHibernate mappings by creating a reference so you can Eagerly fetch the reference and have 1 trip to the database etc. But this really isn't where eager fetching is beneficial!</p>

      <p>A while back <a href="https://twitter.com/ayende">@ayende</a> wrote a <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/156609/reviewing-dinner-party-ndash-nerd-dinner-ported-to-ravendb-on-ravenhq">blog post</a> about <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/DinnerParty">DinnerParty</a> in which he mentioned <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">NancyFX</a>, a lightweight web framework. <a href="https://twitter.com/jchannon">@jchannon</a> recently wrote about a <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/">blog post about NancyFX RavenDB and himself</a>.</p>

<p>So I've spent the better part of the last few months learning it, and needless to say, it's awesome. So I got asked a question, how would I handle 'Areas' with Nancy, like we would with ASP.NET MVC?</p>

<p>Well it's pretty simple, all it really consists of is... a module containing a root path.</p>

<p>Lets begin with the following folder structure defining a 'HomeModule' for both the Root Website, and the Admin section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nancy-areas-1.png" /></p>

<p>Both these HomeModule classes are identical, with the small exception that the Admin one specifies a Root Path.</p>

      <p>I have absolutely no idea who made this retarded feature but if I met them, I would like to think I would punch them in the face for all the pain they have caused me, of making me reformat my computer thinking I had somehow stuffed up my installation of the OS.</p>

<p>Windows 7 and 8 have this feature which allows an application to take priority of the speakers. Meaning if you're in Application A, and you're playing music, and you swap to Application B, then B will reduce the volume of A so that itself can have louder volume.</p>

<p>This is really annoying when you want to play music, and then you load up a game, and the music is drowned out by game sounds.</p>

<p>The solution? Disable that shit!</p>

<p>1) Go into your Playback devices:</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-volume-1.png" /></p>

<p>2) Select the device properties:</p>

<p>In part 3 I want to show you how to query References.</p>

<p>In the previous post I showed you three basic classes that demonstrate a Relationship between Order and OrderLine, and a Reference to User from Order using the UserId.</p>

<p>I've setup some really basic test data:</p>

<pre><code>using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Phillip",
        Surname = "Haydon",
        Username = "phillip.haydon",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Edward",
        Surname = "Norton",
        Username = "edward.norton",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new Order
    {
        UserId = "users/1",
        DateOrdered = DateTime.Now,
        DateUpdated = DateTime.Now,
        Status = "Ordered",
        Lines = new List&lt;OrderLine&gt;
        {
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            },
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            }
        }
    });
    session.SaveChanges();
}
</code></pre>
