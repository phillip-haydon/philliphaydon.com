      <p>I have absolutely no idea who made this retarded feature but if I met them, I would like to think I would punch them in the face for all the pain they have caused me, of making me reformat my computer thinking I had somehow stuffed up my installation of the OS.</p>

<p>Windows 7 and 8 have this feature which allows an application to take priority of the speakers. Meaning if you're in Application A, and you're playing music, and you swap to Application B, then B will reduce the volume of A so that itself can have louder volume.</p>

<p>This is really annoying when you want to play music, and then you load up a game, and the music is drowned out by game sounds.</p>

<p>The solution? Disable that shit!</p>

<p>1) Go into your Playback devices:</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-volume-1.png" /></p>

<p>2) Select the device properties:</p>

<p>In part 3 I want to show you how to query References.</p>

<p>In the previous post I showed you three basic classes that demonstrate a Relationship between Order and OrderLine, and a Reference to User from Order using the UserId.</p>

<p>I've setup some really basic test data:</p>

<pre><code>using (var session = store.OpenSession())
{
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Phillip",
        Surname = "Haydon",
        Username = "phillip.haydon",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new User
    {
        FirstName = "Edward",
        Surname = "Norton",
        Username = "edward.norton",
        Password = "somepassword"
    });
    session.Store(new Order
    {
        UserId = "users/1",
        DateOrdered = DateTime.Now,
        DateUpdated = DateTime.Now,
        Status = "Ordered",
        Lines = new List&lt;OrderLine&gt;
        {
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            },
            new OrderLine
            {
                Discount = 0m,
                PricePerUnit = 13.95m,
                Quantity = 5,
                SkuCode = "SN78"
            }
        }
    });
    session.SaveChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This creates two collections:</p>

<a href="/2012/07/ravendb-what-am-i-persisting-what-am-i-querying-part-2/">Part 2</a> I want to discuss Relationships &amp; References, and the difference between the two.<br />
<a href="/2012/07/ravendb-what-am-i-persisting-what-am-i-querying-part-3/">Part 3</a>  </p>

<p>Taking from part 1's example, lets add a User to the mix:</p>

<pre><code>public class Order
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string DateOrdered { get; set; }
    public string DateUpdated { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
    public IEnumerable&lt;OrderLine&gt; Lines { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine
{
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public decimal Discount { get; set; }
    public string SkuCode { get; set; }
    // Other Properties
}

public class User
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string Surname { get; set; }
    // Other Properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I've added 'UserId' to the Order, not a 'User' just the Id part. This is because I don't want direct access to the User. <em>(It is possible to map a User in RavenDB, but I don't believe that is always a good idea. Save it for special occasions.)</em></p>

<p>A couple of questions that pop's up a lot in the <a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/RavenDB">#RavenDB</a> <a href="https://jabbr.net/">JabbR</a> chat room by people picking up RavenDB for the first time are; <em>what am I persisting?, and how do I query relationships?.</em></p>

<p>When we use relational databases we often de-normalize our data into multiple tables, usually this is done to get rid of duplication of data. We do this by adding 100's of foreign keys to our tables relating things all over the place, we had a CountryId to our Address, a UserId to our Order, an OrderId to our OrderLine.</p>

<p>There's many reasons why this was done, some of which Oren describes in his <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/153026/embracing-ravendb">Embracing RavenDB post.</a></p>

<p>Then when we go to query those relationships we have to join data, when we have an entity with multiple relationships we end up getting into complex queries with cartesian joins, performance starts to degrade, and things just get messy.</p>

<p>When working with Document Databases we throw all that out the window and we deal with Root Aggregates. These are objects that are responsible for their child objects, you don't load the child objects individually, they are loaded with the root or parent object.</p>

        <span>posted on 18 Jun 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Yesterday (14th of June) I had a need to run more than one website while running <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrain's</a> <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/">DotTrace</a>, to give a bit of background, Website A needs to redirect to Website B in order to simulate a single sign on.</p>

<p>Website B can't be accessed without using the SSO, so in order to profile Website B I need to run Website A.</p>

<p>The problem is when using DotTrace, I have to select the website I wish to profile:</p>

<p><img src="/images/multiple-iis-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem with that, is that when you run the profiler it only starts up one of the websites. I need it to start both.</p>

<p>This would be easy to profile if the Standard Version came with Attach To Process feature. But unfortunately that only comes with Professional.</p>

<p>That way, when I debug using Visual Studio I could pick the process to profile:</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>A few people have asked me how they can use ServiceStack with other persistence technologies like RavenDB and NHibernate, or if you really must... EntityFramework... Rather than <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">ServiceStack.OrmLite</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis">ServiceStack.Redis</a> like many of the examples in SS show.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This isn't about best practice on using NHibernate or ServiceStack, my services are named just to quickly get something up and running.</span></p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note 2:</strong> This blog post may not be completely inline with the GitHub repository since I will be updating the repository to include some additional samples in the future.</span></p>

<p>I've created a small sample project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/phillip-haydon/ServiceStack-NHibernate-Sample">here on GitHub</a>, I plan to flesh it out a little bit from the date this is posted, but it's purely there as a sample.</p>

<h2>No Repositories!</h2>

<p>Utilizing other persistence frameworks is really easy with ServiceStack, the thing with ServiceStack Services is that they are doing something concise, it's a single service implementation, so there's really no need to use repositories for them, you gain absolutely no benefit from using repositories other than adding an additional layer of abstraction and complexity to your services.</p>

      <p>On the 1st of April, Glenn Block posted a link that was too good to be true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com">http://www.codeschool.com</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/code-school-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have a habit of checking out most links that don't look like they link to a porn site or some look at photo of me and signup to see me naked. This particular link interested me because his tweet mentioned Backbone, something I've been wanting to learn for a while and that I'm been hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/derickbailey">Derick Bailey</a> would add to his awesome JavaScript video collection: <a href="http://www.watchmecode.net">http://www.watchmecode.net</a> (<strong><em>his JavaScript series is absolutely brilliant and I've learnt SO much from him so go support him so he will make more plz kthxbi</em></strong>)</p>

<p>Anyway CodeSchool allows you to do level 1 of most courses for free, and if you like what you try you can purchase the rest of the course. Buying the courses 1 by 1 is a little bit expensive at $55 USD, but it's well worth the money.</p>

<p>You're not getting just a video like you would with sites like Plural Sight, Tekpub, or any of the many other site's popping up lately.</p>

<p>After each lesson in the course, there's a series of challenges which allow you to utilize your new gained knowledge and put it to the test. The Backbone course challenges you to make a small ToDo list application, starting out really basic and slowly modifying the code to follow best practice, or add new features.</p>

<h3>ReSharper</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/</a></p>

<p>This should just ship with Visual Studio, without ReSharper I feel so unproductive in VS.</p>

        <span>posted on 19 Mar 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>There seems to be a growing trend now with these Micro ORM's, at least that is what I see with <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">ServiceStack.OrmLite</a>, which is the ability to persist properties of an object as a JSON, rather than in separate tables.</p>

<p>Usually with a Relational approach you would create a <code>Customer</code> table, <code>Address</code> table, and most likely shove the Phone Numbers under separate columns of the customer for <code>HomePhone</code> and <code>Mobile</code>.</p>

<p>This means we are limited to two types of phone numbers, and require joining or querying for the addresses.</p>

<p>Do we really need separate columns for phone numbers? Do we really need to persist the addresses in another table?</p>

<p>One problem I see with putting addresses into it's own table, is the temptation to relate them to an Order (assuming this is some sort of eCommerce system) when really there is no relationship between a customer's address, and the address on an order.</p>

<p>Really, the order should have it's own address, otherwise you can never delete or update an address on a customer, and you can't delete the customer. However I digress and this is a topic for another day.</p>
