      <p>I installed Visual Studio 2012 over the weekend, and was BLOWN AWAY when I created a brand new MVC 4 project to find:</p>

<p><img src="/images/asp-real-empty-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>See that 'Empty' project... It now creates:</p>

<p><img src="/images/asp-real-empty-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look at that, nice and clean. It still forces the whole WebApi thing on you, but atleast they cut out 90% of the rubbish that was in it previously.</p>

<p>I'm REALLY happy with the changes after I previously ranted earlier this year:</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>A few people have asked me how they can use ServiceStack with other persistence technologies like RavenDB and NHibernate, or if you really must... EntityFramework... Rather than <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">ServiceStack.OrmLite</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis">ServiceStack.Redis</a> like many of the examples in SS show.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This isn't about best practice on using NHibernate or ServiceStack, my services are named just to quickly get something up and running.</span></p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note 2:</strong> This blog post may not be completely inline with the GitHub repository since I will be updating the repository to include some additional samples in the future.</span></p>

<p>I've created a small sample project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/phillip-haydon/ServiceStack-NHibernate-Sample">here on GitHub</a>, I plan to flesh it out a little bit from the date this is posted, but it's purely there as a sample.</p>

<h2>No Repositories!</h2>

<p>Utilizing other persistence frameworks is really easy with ServiceStack, the thing with ServiceStack Services is that they are doing something concise, it's a single service implementation, so there's really no need to use repositories for them, you gain absolutely no benefit from using repositories other than adding an additional layer of abstraction and complexity to your services.</p>

      <p>On the 1st of April, Glenn Block posted a link that was too good to be true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com">http://www.codeschool.com</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/code-school-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have a habit of checking out most links that don't look like they link to a porn site or some look at photo of me and signup to see me naked. This particular link interested me because his tweet mentioned Backbone, something I've been wanting to learn for a while and that I'm been hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/derickbailey">Derick Bailey</a> would add to his awesome JavaScript video collection: <a href="http://www.watchmecode.net">http://www.watchmecode.net</a> (<strong><em>his JavaScript series is absolutely brilliant and I've learnt SO much from him so go support him so he will make more plz kthxbi</em></strong>)</p>

<p>Anyway CodeSchool allows you to do level 1 of most courses for free, and if you like what you try you can purchase the rest of the course. Buying the courses 1 by 1 is a little bit expensive at $55 USD, but it's well worth the money.</p>

<p>You're not getting just a video like you would with sites like Plural Sight, Tekpub, or any of the many other site's popping up lately.</p>

<p>After each lesson in the course, there's a series of challenges which allow you to utilize your new gained knowledge and put it to the test. The Backbone course challenges you to make a small ToDo list application, starting out really basic and slowly modifying the code to follow best practice, or add new features.</p>

      <p>We have all seen these lists before, but I've decided I'll make a list of all the software I use or think are a must have, blog it, then this time next year I can do the list again and see how much it's changed.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio 2010</h3>

<p>What can I say, I'm a .NET Developer :)</p>

<h3>ReSharper</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/</a></p>

<p>This should just ship with Visual Studio, without ReSharper I feel so unproductive in VS.</p>

<h3>MindScape Web Workbench</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench">http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench</a></p>

<p>This VS extension just gets better and better, I primarily got it to write LESS and CoffeeScript, but recently they added support for minifying and combining JavaScript and CSS files. Really cool stuff and I highly recommend it.</p>

        <span>posted on 19 Mar 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>There seems to be a growing trend now with these Micro ORM's, at least that is what I see with <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">ServiceStack.OrmLite</a>, which is the ability to persist properties of an object as a JSON, rather than in separate tables.</p>

<p>Usually with a Relational approach you would create a <code>Customer</code> table, <code>Address</code> table, and most likely shove the Phone Numbers under separate columns of the customer for <code>HomePhone</code> and <code>Mobile</code>.</p>

<p>This means we are limited to two types of phone numbers, and require joining or querying for the addresses.</p>

<p>Do we really need separate columns for phone numbers? Do we really need to persist the addresses in another table?</p>

<p>One problem I see with putting addresses into it's own table, is the temptation to relate them to an Order (assuming this is some sort of eCommerce system) when really there is no relationship between a customer's address, and the address on an order.</p>

<p>Really, the order should have it's own address, otherwise you can never delete or update an address on a customer, and you can't delete the customer. However I digress and this is a topic for another day.</p>

<p>One of the most painful experiences with WCF is exceptions, if using WCF makes you want to slit your wrists, exceptions in WCF will make you want douse yourself in petrol and light yourself on fire.</p>

<p>Before you even get to your code exceptions, you have to wade yourself through piles of retarded errors to do with Contract Mismatching, Forcefully Disconnected, Binding Issues, Random Faults... The list goes on.</p>

<p>Then, it all works in development, and you put it in production, and it doesn't work, and to debug it you got to modify the config file, setup the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732023.aspx">diagnostics logging</a>, then view it and trawl through piles of crap.</p>

      <p>One of the guys in <a href="http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/RavenDB">JabbR RavenDB</a> chat room had a pretty interesting problem that took a while to solve. The problem was that he wasn't trying to return anything to do with the original document, but get a flattened view of some information inside the document.</p>

<p>The scenario was a <strong>Game Server</strong> which a collection of <strong>Connected Users</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>public class GameServer
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string ServerName { get; set; }

        public string Name { get; set; }

<p>Given say 3 servers with a bunch of users on each server, and searching for a user who's name begins with 'b' the expected result was along the lines of:</p>

      <p>I've just spent the weekend ripping out that dreaded WCF abomination and replacing it with Service Stack.</p>

<p><a href="http://servicestack.net/">http://servicestack.net/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A modern fresh alternative to WCF. Code-first, convention-based, codegen-free. Encourages best-practices high-performance, scalable REST &amp; RPC web services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the past couple of months I've been fighting with WCF to the point I wanted to slit my wrists.</p>

<p>So I asked <a href="http://jabbr.net/">JabbR</a> and Twitter if I should use Web API. Well -no- one recommended Web API and everyone recommended Service Stack.</p>

<h2>It's a different way of thinking</h2>

<p>The first noticeable difference between WCF and SS (Service Stack) is that I'm no longer writing a single service class with a butt load of methods. Which is most likely a good thing because after a while they just become hard to manage.</p>

<p>So instead of a Contract, Service, Response DTO, and Request DTO, with 9234823 methods defined in the Contract/Service. It's now <strong>1 Request DTO per Service.</strong></p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>I've setup 10 posts (<a href="http://pastie.org/3200462">click here for the insert pastie</a>) just with some really basic data.</p>
