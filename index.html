      <p>Repositories are one of those patterns we hate to love or love to hate, but seems to be getting more hate lately than love. </p>

<p>Personally I don't have any real problem with repositories themselves, I just have a problem with the way it is used. </p>

<p>If you run the following search in Google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BaseRepository OR GenericRepository OR IRepository site:stackoverflow.com</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will get about 10k results on Stack Overflow for questions that contain something related to a generic repository or base repository. You end up with code snippets such as:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IRepository&lt;TEntity&gt; : IDisposable where TEntity : class
{
    IUnitOfWork Session { get; }
    IList&lt;TEntity&gt; GetAll();
    IList&lt;TEntity&gt; GetAll(Expression&lt;Func&lt;TEntity, bool&gt;&gt; predicate);
    bool Add(TEntity entity);
    bool Delete(TEntity entity);
    bool Update(TEntity entity);
    bool IsValid(TEntity entity);
}

        <span>posted on 25 Dec 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Just now I released Snow v1.4.0 :) with this we have two new features.</p>

<ol>
<li>New <code>server=true</code> argument on Snow to run up an Owin testing website.</li>
<li>Merged assemblies</li>
</ol>

<h2>New server argument</h2>

<p>When running Snow, you can now pass in an additional argument <code>server=true</code> which will start up a self-hosted website which will allow you to test your updates before pushing them.</p>

<p>Given my blog for example, my config looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>.\Snow\_compiler\Snow.exe config=.\Snow\ debug=true server=true
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I run this:</p>

      <p>I'm not a fan of Workflow Foundation, but you got to do what you got to do. Usually when using WF, unit testing an activity is rather easy. Invoke with some data, assert the out value, possibly watch some methods on some dependencies...</p>

<p>But when it comes to testing Bookmarks, if the bookmark is created, and resuming it, it's not easy...</p>

<p>Well that is unless you're using <a href="http://wf.codeplex.com">Microsoft.Activities.UnitTesting</a></p>

        <span>posted on 12 Dec 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Lately I've found myself using the new Git support in Visual Studio 2013 more and more, it turns out once you get used to it, its quite handy! Initially my thoughts were its rubbish, mostly because I found it cumbersome, or maybe just that things weren't working the way I thought they were. I do fine some things strange, but it's still completely usable!</p>

<p>How does it all work?</p>

<p>Let's start by creating a new project:</p>

<p><img src="/images/git-support-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I ticked the <code>Create new Git repository</code> option in the bottom right hand corner, this just initializes the folder for you. </p>

<p>Now that the project is created, we can open the Team Explorer, it should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/git-support-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>I'm not entirely sure why it does this but when I create new projects, the solution file is never included by default?!?</em></p>

<p>So the solution file is excluded, we can right click the file(s) and include them...</p>

      <p>A special thanks goes out to <a href="https://twitter.com/johanilsson">@johanilsson</a> for this new feature!</p>

<p>Snow now ships with Drafts and Privates, this is a really cool feature since it allows you to create drafts, and a page to list all drafts (optional). </p>

<h2>What are the options</h2>

<p>There are three options for a <code>published</code> state:</p>

<ul>
<li>draft</li>
<li>private</li>
<li>true</li>
</ul>

<p>Draft is basically a finished or rough cut blog post that you will publish soon, it will be compiled to <code>/drafts</code> URL and be publicly accessible (either via a known page or the direct URL)</p>

<p>Private is a post that will not be compiled at all, this will stay as markdown, good for when you want to begin writing something but not have it show up online yet.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>One problem I think a lot of developers have, is creating Controllers and Modules that are small and maintainable. Sometimes when you add some querying, bit of validation, pass it off to a repository or service, etc. It begins to become a little bit too big. </p>

<p>Lets assume our we have an <code>AccountModule</code> it Gets a Login route to load the UI, and Posts to a Login route to authenticate the user, and do something.</p>

<p>It also Gets a Register route to load the UI, and Posts to a Register route to register the new user. </p>

<p>Without an actual implementation, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class AccountModule : NancyModule
{
    public AccountModule() : base("/account")
    {
        Get["/login"] = _ =&gt; "login";
        Post["/login"] = _ =&gt; "login";

        Get["/register"] = _ =&gt; "register";
        Post["/register"] = _ =&gt; "register";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To begin with, we only have 4 things to implement, its rather small, somewhat easy to manage, but what happens when we want to update an account?</p>

      <p>There's so much information on the internet in terms of JavaScript Unit Testing and how to run tests etc, but when it comes to running tests in Visual Studio, without a browser, there's very little information. I had to piece information together to figure it out.</p>

<p>So I'm going to do a small series on this.</p>

<h2>Setup PhantomJS</h2>

<p>To run JavaScript tests without a browser, we need PhantomJS, and we need to wire it up into Resharper.</p>

        <span>posted on 05 Oct 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Last week I saw a tweet about Semantic-UI, which I had not heard about, I guess it's relatively new. I decided to take a look and to be honest. I love what I see.</p>

<p>So to get rolling I decided to create a basic registration form for a personal project using it. </p>

<h2>What is Semantic UI</h2>

<p>Well, for starters, its a rather large library :| coming in total at a whopping 333kb for just the minified CSS an JavaScript.</p>

<p>That's not including the Fonts <em>(roughly 50kb, unless you like SVG which is 194kb, but who the hell uses that crap)</em>, Images which are about 3-10kb, though you probably only use 1 or 2 per app depending on what you're doing. These are all loading gifs, all other images are... well done using Font-Awesome. Which happens to be rolled into the library.</p>

<p>But for what the library does, its pretty damn impressive. </p>

<p>The idea is that Semantic is a more fluent and structured way to writing a web application, rather than naming stuff poorly like Bootstrap does with things like <code>col-lg-4</code>, Semantic opts for <code>column</code>. This is both good and bad. The examples on their homepage are more semantic, but at the cost of either writing less or more code in order to describe the UI elements in the markup. </p>

<p>Reading the examples is awesome, in fact I wanted to right align a button, I started out with:</p>

<p><code>ui blue submit button</code></p>

<p>I thought "I want that floated right, it would look better...", and I ended up with</p>

<p><code>ui blue submit button floated right</code></p>

<p>You end up writing lots but instead of shifting around in CSS to figure out how to move it from left to right, I just described it. Sure enough, button sat on the right hand side!</p>

      <p>I've only been blogging since 2009, and my blog had gone through multiple iterations. I began on BlogEngine.NET, moved onto Wordpress, then was introduced to Jekyll. </p>

<p>I loved Jekyll, but I personally found it fiddly, and people who I've spoken to have also found it fiddly, but are quiet happy after they had set it up.</p>

<p>I really liked the idea, so I thought I would recreate it in .NET :) Because reinventing the wheel is fun!</p>

<h2>Introducing Sandra.Snow</h2>

<p>With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/jchannon">@jchannon</a>, I've managed release Snow. Using NancyFX we have created a small application that allows you to write Markdown Posts with Razor Layouts, which will be compiled static HTML files.</p>

<p>Currently, besides my own, I'm aware of 3 other blogs running on Snow:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com">blog.jonathanchannon.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thecodejunkie.com/">thecodejunkie.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.owenrumney.co.uk/">blog.owenrumney.co.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So what is it? Basically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sandra.Snow is a Jekyll inspired static site generation tool that can be run locally, as a CAAS(Compiler as a Service) or setup with Azure to build your site when your repository changes. It is built on top of NancyFX.</p>

      <p>Just today, <a href="https://twitter.com/chr_horsdal">Christian Horsdal</a> released his first book, his first topic to write a book about, only the most awesome Web Framework to exist in .NET! :)</p>

<p><img src="/images/nancy-book-review-1a.png" alt="" /></p>

<li><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/nancy-web-development/book">Packt Publishing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This book is rather short, clocking in at only 74 pages. Not to worry though, it covers quite a bit! </p>

<p>Usually I don't go near Packt Publishing books after having a bad experience buying a few books, all of which were terrible. But seeing as this was a Nancy book I couldn't pass up the chance to check it out. </p>

<p>Considering this is the first book Christian has written, it reads very well. I've read books from authors who have done 3 or 4 books and I struggle to read them because their style of writing. So that alone impressed me about this book.</p>
