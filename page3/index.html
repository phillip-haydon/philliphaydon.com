      <p>I just got done reading a <a href="http://blog.filipekberg.se/2013/03/04/everyone-should-learn-programming/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/fekberg">@fekberg</a> titled "Everyone Should Learn Programming"</p>

<p>This idea that everyone should learn to program seems to be a growing trend. But I disagree. </p>

<p>I don't think <code>everyone</code> should learn to program, I think everyone should get the opportunity to learn to program. Schooling in general is a waste of time because it caters to this idea that life evolves around English, Math, Art, Science and General Knowledge. But real life doesn't, and these things don't help children figure out what they are good at or enjoy.</p>

<p>There's an awesome TED video by Sir Ken Robinson titled "Do Schools Kill Creativity"</p>

        <span>posted on 26 Feb 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>In my last post about <a href="http://www.philliphaydon.com/2013/01/windows-store-app-with-caliburn-micro-basic-binding">Basic Binding</a> we added the ability to Hide/Show a control using Viability property of the control to make it <code>Visible</code> or <code>Collapsed</code></p>

<p>However the View Model shouldn't have any real knowledge of how the view works, meaning it shouldn't actually dictate the visibility using the controls properties.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I left this out of the original post because I wanted to keep it 'Basic' without confusing binding with converters and such, making the topic more complicated</span></p>

<p>If in the future you changed from say <code>TextBlock</code> to a 3rd party control called <code>BananaTextBlock</code> and that 3rd party decided that they were not going to use the built in Viability enum, and instead decided to create their own naming convention, and enum etc. You would be forced to change your ViewModel, which isn't good.</p>

<p>That's where Value Converters come in handy. </p>

<p>Back in December I blogged about <a href="/2012/12/windows-store-app-with-caliburn-micro-getting-started/">getting started</a> with Caliburn.Micro, not long after I created the post a <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg/archive/2013/01/20/caliburn-micro-v1-4-1-released.aspx">new version</a> (v1.4.1) was released.</p>

<p>The changes in this release break my previous blog post so I'm updating here.</p>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The original post still applies, the change is only to the setup of the App</span></p>

<h2>App Setup</h2>

<p>In the previous post when we configured the container, all we needed to do was Register the WinRT Services.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>I searched for hours trying to figure this out and I think the information is a little scarce or not obvious.</p>

<p>Basically I wanted to add some advertising to my app, I'm trying to cover multiple different area's in order to learn what's involved, and I thought I had it all down, only to work out that the advert's that were displaying were test adverts and not the real thing.</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong, when you actually do find the correct URL (by searching Advertising rather than Ad) the MSDN link does have all the information, I didn't find this out until my friend actually sent it to me...</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/advertising-windows-sdk(v=msads.10).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/advertising-windows-sdk(v=msads.10).aspx</a></p>

<p>There's two main things you need to do (besides installing the correct SDK, I had the Beta first time around)</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the advert into your app</li>
<li>Setup an advertising account</li>
</ol>

<p>The first part is easy... (well the 2nd part is too... but I didn't realise that at first)</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Forms in HTML only allow you to use the method's POST and GET, I'm not sure if this would be classified as a limitation or not, but it does introduce a slight problem when you want to create a nice API taking advantage of verbs such as PUT and DELETE, when you can only POST and GET. </p>

<p>This means if you want to delete something you have to use a different URL, like:</p>

<p><code>/products/123/delete</code></p>

<p>Then define a route like</p>

<pre><code>Post["/products/{id}/delete"] = _ =&gt;
{
    ... Do Something...
};
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't exactly ideal, what we would prefer to have is a more semantic route.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GET</code> -> gets an object</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> -> deletes an object</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> -> modifies an object</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code> -> modifies part of an object</li>
<li><code>POST</code> -> creates an object</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I'm no expert on this stuff so the VERBs above may not be correct wording.</span></p>

<p>This would allow us to define the same route like so</p>

<pre><code>Delete["/products/{id}"] = _ =&gt;
{
    ... Do Something...
};

      <p>This post is a follow on from my previous post <a href="/2013/01/oauth-with-nancyfx-and-world-domination-authentication/">OAuth with NancyFX and WorldDomination.Web.Authentication</a> except this demonstrates how you can use WorldDomination.Web.Authentication with ASP.NET MVC, writing only minimal code in the process.</p>

<p>To save you jumping to the other post, I'll quote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the biggest pains of building websites, in my opinion, is implementing OAuth providers, it's often fiddly, doesn't work, and frameworks that are created to try make things easier, don't seem to make it easier. </p>
  
  <p>So <a href="https://github.com/PureKrome">PureKrome</a> and myself decided to create <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/WorldDomination.Web.Authentication/">WorldDomination: Web Authentication</a></p>
  
  <p>The idea behind this framework is to keep it super simple to implement OAuth into your website, without the bloat. The core framework ONLY deals with Google, Twitter, and Facebook authentication. It doesn't try to create a fancy UI for you, it doesn't require you to write lots and lots of code. You simply give it some info, it redirects, it comes back and gives you the authentication info.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without further adieu...</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p>Installing the library for MVC requires installing the MVC specific library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PM> Install-Package WorldDomination.Web.Authentication.Mvc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will install:</p>

<ul>
<li>WorldDomination.Web.Authentication.Mvc</li>
<li>WorldDomination.Web.Authentication</li>
<li>RestSharp</li>
</ul>

        <span>posted on 29 Jan 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>So not long ago I <a href="/2012/10/keep-an-eye-on-raygun-to-zap-all-your-errors-away/">posted</a> about an up and coming service from <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com">http://www.mindscapehq.com</a> called <a href="http://www.raygun.io">Raygun</a>, well last week they went into beta, and I was invited, so since early last week I've been giving their system the run around and provided a little bit of feedback. </p>

<p>I say a little bit, because besides being a super early beta tester, and a super early product that will grow over time, the beta is quite polished. There was only a few minor issues which they corrected within a day or less. </p>

<p><img src="/images/raygun-beta-robby-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Raygun is super easy to setup and implement into your application, in-fact it's really nothing more than creating an app, install the nuget package, and set the key, and away you go. </p>

<p>There's a simple guide over <a href="http://www.pieterg.com/2013/1/raygunio-has-launched">http://www.pieterg.com/2013/1/raygunio-has-launched</a>, so I won't bore you with the same content.</p>

<h2>Nancy.Raygun</h2>

<p>Currently the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mindscape.Raygun4Net/">offical Nuget package</a> has a dependency on System.Web which isn't very nice for Nancy, so I've created <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy.Raygun/">Nancy.Raygun</a></p>

<p>It has no dependency on <code>System.Web</code>, and uses the <code>NancyContext</code> rather than <code>HttpContext.Current</code>, it also implements <code>IApplicationStartup</code> so that it automatically wires itself up for handling errors for you.</p>

<p>Nancy.Raygun is on <a href="https://github.com/phillip-haydon/Nancy.Raygun">Github</a>, installing the nuget package will add the web.config for you so all you need to do is add the key and away you go.</p>

<h2>Why Raygun?</h2>

<p>I've had a few people ask me why I would use Raygun over ELMAH, or AppFail. </p>

        <span>posted on 25 Jan 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Yup, I decided to reinvent the wheel, don't hate on me :)</p>

<p>So I grew a little fustrated, theres quite a few serverside validation libraries around, but I feel they do too much, are hard to test, yada yada yada...</p>

<p>So I came up with Sandra.SimpleValidation</p>

<p>The idea is that it's dead simple, it requires 0 up front configuration, it doesn't allow you to inject stuff into the validators, validators are newed up once and only once, there's no client-side validation.</p>

<p>I don't believe validation should allow you to do things like inject a repository and query the database, those begin to become Business Rules and should be handled seperately. All it does is validate a model you give it. </p>

<p>So what do you need to do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PM> Install-Package Sandra.SimpleValidator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First up, install the package. It requires 4.0 or above, it could probably work on 3.5 but who uses that anymore?</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>Continuing on with the SampleProject for a Windows Store App, we will look at binding, this is where we will finally make use of the ViewModel. </p>

<p>In the previous example we output the text 'Hello World' to the screen, but rather than put it on the screen directly we can load it when we load the view.</p>

<p>First we need to create a ViewModel, Caliburn works on a naming convention so if your view is named <code>MainView</code>, your view model needs to be naned <code>MainViewModel</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-store-binding-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In our class we want to inherit from <code>Screen</code>, this is a Caliburn class that is used to represent a single screen, your application may have many screens but for now we are only dealing with a single screen. </p>

<pre><code>using Caliburn.Micro;

namespace SampleProject.ViewModels
{
    public class MainViewModel : Screen
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
