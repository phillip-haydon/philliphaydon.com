      <p>Every time I touch Azure I'm constantly amazed at how much simpler it is compared to when I tried it back when it had the crappy Silverlight management site.</p>

<p>Infact every time I touch the thing I over-complicate something only to realize it was dead simple to begin with.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the process of slowly building a VM to run a few small websites I'm building in my own time. Based on what I need Azure will cost me $60 less each month for roughly the same specs (with about 256mb less ram)</p>

<p>The first time creating a VM took me a couple of hours to setup and working, nuking it and starting again took about as long as it took to provision the VM (few minutes)</p>

</ul>

<p>In part 1 I went over a really basic scenario, and one of the fiddly things we had was the view name for returning a collection.</p>

<p>Using <code>Negotiate</code> gives as more flexibility on what we can return, allowing us to customize the response to respond differently to different media types or returning partial content in some scenarios.</p>

<p>Going back to my previous post I said we should be able to use the same API to build our website as we expose. But what about when we want to have additional information on the website that isn't pushed out to the client.</p>

<p>Lets say you have a product catalog, and you can view a particular product on your website. You also allow people to pull the content from your site to display on their website as like an affiliate system of some sort. But when you render your product you may have a special, but when you send the product to the consuming client you don't want to include the special for them since it's something specific to your website.</p>

<h2>Show me the codez!</h2>

<p>So lets update the <code>Product</code> to include <code>SpecialPrice</code></p>

      <p>I just discovered this little trick I found in Visual Studio to turn off namespacing on a folder. Not sure how after 8 years I only just found this.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Lets assume we're working with Entity Framework... (shiver)... We create a Data Model, add all our Entities and away we go. </p>

<p>Then we want to extend one of the Entities, maybe to add some methods and such, so we need to create some partial classes. So far we have:</p>

<p><img src="/images/visual-studio-namespacing-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We create a new <code>Member.cs</code> class in the <code>Partials</code> folder;</p>

<p>I thought I would revisit this topic since I don't believe I did it enough justice last time around, and I believe it really is important when creating an API that is going to be consumed not only by the public or client, but <strong>by you also</strong>!</p>

<p>When the browser asks for <code>text/html</code> its negotiating with the server. So really your website is an API, your <code>Views</code> are just an additional type of content that your API serves up when requested.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Lets say you're building Twitter, the initial page shows a list of tweets, so the browser makes a call to <code>/tweets</code> and the server responds with a list of tweets rendered with using HTML.</p>

<p>Once the page has loaded, the client uses JavaScript to load new tweets, so it calls <code>/tweets</code> again, this time it returns a <code>json</code> result, and the client-side templating engine then renders and appends those to the top of the existing list, keeping the client up to date with the latest tweets.</p>

<p>What's nice is no new data needed to be written on the server! </p>

        <span>posted on 09 Apr 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>With the up and coming release of 0.17 of NancyFX, the routing has been completely rewritten, and now it's super easy to implement your own routing. So I'm going to show you how.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The routing works by defining a route:</p>

<p><code>Get["/products/{id}"]</code></p>

<p>The route is then broken up into segments:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>products</code></li>
<li><code>{id}</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Each segment is checked against a Node Condition in the <code>TrieNodeFactory</code> like so</p>

<pre><code>if (segment.StartsWith("(") &amp;&amp; segment.EndsWith(")"))
{
    return new RegExNode(parent, segment, this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a request comes in, the segment is compared to the node for a match and returns true/false + the captured parameter. </p>

<p>These are a bunch of conditions for checking different nodes, currently Nancy supports out of the box the following nodes.</p>

<h2>Existing Nodes</h2>

<p>This is brief description of the existing nodes that currently exist in 0.17. </p>

<h3>CaptureNode</h3>

<p>This node captures <code>{foo}</code>, or basically any value defined in the segment.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>I've been using Raygun.io for a couple of months now and seen a whole heap of new features added.</p>

<h3>Email Spam</h3>

<p>If you had multiple apps you would get spammed with 1 summary email each day for each app, now you get an aggregation of all apps which is much nicer. </p>

<p>If you receive an email for an exception, and that exception keeps occurring, it will email you a little while later saying that you're still receiving the exception, the rate at which its occurring, and if it's happening more or less.</p>

<p>These changes are great! Still the same valuable information, but more smartly distributed to the user.</p>

<h3>Commenting</h3>

<p>I had an error, that occurred a lot... </p>

<p><img src="/images/raygun-features-javascript-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So after fixing it, which took a little bit of effort to figure out, I commented on it!</p>

        <span>posted on 02 Apr 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I had an awesome conversation on Monday with Glenn Block about Microsoft in regards to OSS, as a result Glenn asked me to write a post about what I would like to see Microsoft do.</p>

<p>To be clear, everyone has their own opinions about what Microsoft is doing with Open Source Software, whats working, whats not, that isn't the point of this post. This is about what I would like to see, and why.</p>

<h3>Promote itself with the community, not against it</h3>

<p>One of the things I think Microsoft does is promote itself against the community, it has opened sourced MVC and WebAPI, but people outside the community don't know about the alternatives. </p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that Microsoft actively promotes frameworks like FubuMVC, NancyFX, ServiceStack etc as their own, or in such a way that it overshadows their own stuff. What I would like to see is Microsoft promoting itself along side other frameworks. A lot of the guys who create these other frameworks are advisories for MVC/WebAPI, they help make Microsoft frameworks better, and there's all the people who contribute, and in my personal opinion Microsoft doesn't really give anything back to the community through its main channels.</p>

      <p>I just got done reading a <a href="http://blog.filipekberg.se/2013/03/04/everyone-should-learn-programming/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/fekberg">@fekberg</a> titled "Everyone Should Learn Programming"</p>

<p>This idea that everyone should learn to program seems to be a growing trend. But I disagree. </p>

<p>I don't think <code>everyone</code> should learn to program, I think everyone should get the opportunity to learn to program. Schooling in general is a waste of time because it caters to this idea that life evolves around English, Math, Art, Science and General Knowledge. But real life doesn't, and these things don't help children figure out what they are good at or enjoy.</p>

<p>There's an awesome TED video by Sir Ken Robinson titled "Do Schools Kill Creativity"</p>
